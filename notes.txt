Development notes

   
yes please

I'll add a minimal package.json, switch vercel.json to use @vercel/static-build, create a .vercelignore, and update the todo list to track these deployment steps.

Edited
package.json+9-1
Edited
vercel.json+2-5
Edited
.vercelignore+12-1

All set — files added/updated:

package.json (build script copies game → public/)
vercel.json (now uses @vercel/static-build with public as output)
.vercelignore (excludes common dev files)
Todo list updated. Next I can:

Give the exact commands to push and deploy (Git + Vercel CLI), or
Run npm run build locally and start a dev server to sanity-check.
Which would you like me to do now?
